# Letterdance

A very rough Javascript library that transitions between multiple pages of content by animating individual letters into their new positions on each page.

## Demo

[Check it out!](http://nate-parrott.github.io/letterdance/)

## Documentation

No docs yet (sorry!). Take a look at the example. Basically, just include the `letterdance.js` script, add `class=letterdance` to an element, stick some `div`s inside it, and make sure those divs have lots of empty space between them vertically. (ideally `height: 100vh`).
